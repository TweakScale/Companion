	+ Please backup everything first before installing, so you can rollback if needed.
* **TweakScale Companion for Airplane Plus** should not be used together [AirplanePlus Things](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196254-ksp-18-airplane-plus-things/) on TweakScale 2.4.3.x or older.
	+ TSCAPP will overwrite all TweakScale patches made by anyone else. This can be a problem if **AirplanePlus Things** has any mishaps on its patches, as TSCAPP is meticulously wrote to be accurate and any crafts scaled with faulty patches can misbehave on TSCAPP.
	+ TweakScale 2.4.4.x and newer has a working migration code to mitigate the issue.
