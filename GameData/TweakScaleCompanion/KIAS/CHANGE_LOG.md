	+ Rebrands the thing to "KIAS"
		- KAS was supposed to be added by now, but RealLifeâ„¢ said "no".

* 2021-1010: 1.0.0.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.3.0
	+ TSCo-KIS goes gold!!! **#HURRAY!!**
	+ Refactoring using the new KSPe.Light.TweakScale v2.4 facilities to allow it to be safely installed on rigs without it.

* 2020-0505: 0.0.1.1 Alpha (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.2.2
