# Notes

### Abbreviations

* Entries marked as "*" are suggestions by me, as I had the need to abbreviate these ones. 
* Entries marked as "?" are suggestions from contributors, pending confirmation from 3rd-parties. 
* Entries marked as "!" are collisions, and this need to be arbitrated somehow 
* Entries marked as "==" are synonyms used to designate the same Addâ€™On
