## Description

**TweakScale Companion Program** is a series of "Add'On's Add'Ons", adding TweakScale /L support for third parties but decoupling the target Add'On's life cycle from TweakScale's , easing maintenance and distribution efforts.

The purpose of this project is to provide a centralised, controlled and curated (minimalistic) database to allow TweakScale to keep track of the Companions and propose actions to the user when needed.
