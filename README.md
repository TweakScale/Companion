# TweakScale Companion Program

A centralised database for keeping up with the growing TweakScale Companion Program.

Provides a mega package including all Companions currently published for the lazy installers. This package is updated sparingly, the Companion's repositories (listed below) will always be updated with the latest versions - and are still the canonical way to have everything up to date.

## Description

**TweakScale Companion Program** is a series of "Add'On's Add'Ons", adding TweakScale /L support for third parties but decoupling the target Add'On's life cycle from TweakScale's , easing maintenance and distribution efforts.

The purpose of this project is to provide a centralised, controlled and curated (minimalistic) database to allow TweakScale to keep track of the Companions and propose actions to the user when needed, as well to make TweakScale user's life easier at first installs with a (most of the time) updated collection with all the currently available Companions at once.
